=Truth Values=

- CC means previous test succeeded
- truth value syscalls marked with ? at end (e.g. bitSet?)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=Lamps and Flags (Bits)=

- the Bitshifter uses 1-based bit numbers
- Lamps are numbered from 1 for consistency with manual
- Flags are NOT numbered from 1 

	Bit Id			7eleven     
	----------------------------
	$00-$3F 		Lamp#01-40  
	$40-$7F 		Flag#00-3F (Flag#00 is not usable?)
	$80-$BF 		illegal
	$C0-$FF         Flag#40-7F (Flag#40 is not usable?)

	NOTES:
		- 

	!lampOn
		- turns on logical lamp bit and M08 (main matrix)
		- if lamp already blinking, leave it blinking


-Blinking-

- use setBit, bitSet? syscalls with blink buffer offset ($40)
	!setBit L_Lock_left $40
	!bitSet? L_EscapeRoute_10M $40


-Bit Buffers / Lamp Matrices-

	offset	meaning
	------------------------------------------------------------
	$00 	logical matrix
	$08 	primary lamp matrix (used for blinking?)
	$10 	masked from primary ($08)
	$18 	override data
	$20 	masked from previous ($08,$18)
	$28 	override data
	$30 	masked from previous ($08,$18,$28)
	$38 	override data
	$40 	blink matrix
	$48 	Flag#00-3F
	$50     Flag#40-7F

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=Bit Groups=

- 1 byte id
- 1 byte buffer offset
	$00		lamps
	$40		blink buffer
- Bitgroup#01 includes all controlled lamps

sys_bitgroupOp_ABXY
	A	ROM page of hook routine
	B	0C(rotLeft) 0E(fill), 04(???)
	X	bitgroup + buffer offset
	Y	address of hook routine

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=Multiball Devices (MBDs) / Locks=

- Notes:
	- abstraction: query library for number of balls in play, lock status, etc
	- monitoring only -- no solenoids are fired
	- event driven: each lock has an event handler that is called with an event
	  code
	- dispatchers: different subsystems use !MBD_callHandler_A <CMD> to call
	  the event handler routine 
	- MSW_lock_handler:
		- switch handler used for all locks with the lock number (1-based)
		  encoded in the switch table
		- dispatcher defining events $04 - $09, triggered by switch state
		  changes

- T2 Lock list
		0	Invalid Lock 
		1	Balltrough
		2	Left Scoop
		3	Upper Scoop
		4	Skull Popper
		5	Cannon

- lock data table
	- =LOCKTABLE is WPC table with ^payloaddata for each lock
	- 4-12 bytes per entry: (4 for Lock#00, 11 for BallTrough, 10 for scoops)
		0			lock type (00 for Lock#00 (invalid), 01 for trough, 02 for scoops)
		1-3			event handler reference (3 bytes)
		trough
			4-5		pointer to list of trough switches
			6		SolCmd
			7		pointer to table with 2 bytes
			8-10	???
		scoops
			4-9		???

- lock data in RAM
	- ^MBD_LOCK_DATA in RAM
	- _MBD_NUM_LOCKS rows
	- 5 bytes per entry:
		0	set to $80 on switch closure of lock when byte 1 == 0
		1	LOCK ENABLED when (0, ignore switch closures, except to mark them in byte 0)
		2	NUMBER OF LOCKED BALLS (0 or 1)
		3	Flags (MSW_lock_handler)
		4	Switch (<3B:72D7>   MBD_LT02(scoop)_unknownLockOp[3B]:)

- Lock Event Handlers
	- usage: !MBD_callHandler_A <CMD>

	8		FLAGS F1
	9		FLAGS F2
	10		unknown
	11		unknown

- switch FLAGS F1
	$10		if set, !switchActive? returns true when the switch is open (i.e. negate switch logic)
